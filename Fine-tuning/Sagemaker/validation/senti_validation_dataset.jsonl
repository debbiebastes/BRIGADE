The ratcheting makes it easy to figure out when not to overtighten so that faceplates don't get cracked. It makes unscrewing a breeze as well. The special bits that are included are also nice including the Robertson one.\n\nMinor issues I've noticed are that sometimes bits fall out randomly when taking one out and the hex bits not being security (why?). Otherwise no real issues.\n    ```\n\n    What is the sentiment of that product review?\n    Identify the product being reviewed.\n    Enumerate the positive and negative aspects of the product review.\n    The response should be in JSON format  with the following elements:\n            - Product name\n            - Review Sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral)\n            - Positive comments about the product (Enumerate)\n            - Negative comments about the product (Enumerate)\n\nAnswer:", "answer": "{\n    \"Product name\": \"CompactPro Screwdriver\",\n    \"Review Sentiment\": \"Positive\",\n    \"Positive comments about the product\": [\n        \"Works great for electrical type work\",\n        \"Ratcheting mechanism helps prevent overtightening\",\n        \"Makes unscrewing easy\",\n        \"Includes special bits, including a Robertson bit\"\n    ],\n    \"Negative comments about the product\": [\n        \"Bits sometimes fall out randomly when changing them\",\n        \"Concern about hex bits not being secured\"\n    ]\n}"}
