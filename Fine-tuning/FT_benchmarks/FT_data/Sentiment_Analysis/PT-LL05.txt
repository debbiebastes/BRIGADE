Example #1:
Product Name: Provence French Country-style Wardrobe
Review text: 
```
I am extremely disappointed with this wardrobe. The quality of the materials used is very poor and the construction feels flimsy. The doors do not close properly and the hinges are already coming loose after just a few weeks of use. I expected much better for the price I paid. Would not recommend it.

Example #2:
Product Name: Zen End Table
Review text: 
```
I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

Now, here is another product review from a customer, which is delimited with triple backticks.

Product Name: Keurig K-Compact Single-Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker
Review text: 
```
I'm not a coffee drinker but purchased this for when I have company. I was expecting a small unit but it's about as large as my regular coffee maker. The name suggests it's small. Haven't used yet. Hope it works well!
