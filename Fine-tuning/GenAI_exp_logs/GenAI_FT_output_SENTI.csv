I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par.

The RAM MT speed is 6400MHz, but the motherboard does not allow the XMP profile to go up to the advertised 6400 MT. Mine is capping out at 4800MHz and will refuse to boot if I put the speed any higher. If you have the same motherboard as me and want to stay Corsair, you will need the CMK32GX5M2X6400C38 which only sells as 16GB sticks. Make sure to check the ASUS compatibility website before purchasing any RAM to make sure it will see the advertised MT speed.

It's always a risk with pre-builts that upgrades may not work. This 64Gb memory (2x32) worked just fine in my Lenovo Legion T7 34IAZ7 gaming PC. I can't use it to it's full capacity due to the limitations of the OEM motherboard, but I've got the 64G headroom I was looking for.
