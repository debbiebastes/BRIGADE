Product Name: Zen End Table
Review text: 
```
I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the design is sleek and modern, which complements my living room aesthetic. However, the quality is not up to par. The table arrived with a few scratches and the wood feels a bit flimsy. For the price I paid, I expected better craftsmanship. Overall, I would give it 3 stars.

    Product Name: Kyoto Blossom Lounge Chair
    Review text: 
    ```
The Kyoto Blossom Lounge Chair is stylish and comfortable. However, the assembly was a bit tricky and the fabric started to show signs of wear after a few months of use. It's a decent chair for the price, but I expected better quality.

    Product Name: CompactPro Screwdriver
    Review text: 
    ```
Great screwdriver
I've been using this for mostly electrical type work where this works great. The ratcheting makes it easy to figure out when not to overtighten so that faceplates don't get cracked. It makes unscrewing a breeze as well. The special bits that are included are also nice including the Robertson one.

Minor issues I've noticed are that sometimes bits fall out randomly when taking one out and the hex bits not being security (why?). Otherwise no real issues.
